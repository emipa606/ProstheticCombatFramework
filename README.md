# Prosthetic Combat Framework
**Not Just Another Combat Prostheses Framework.** An expansion of vanilla hediff verb system with advanced verb support and friendly modification via xml.

## Details
This framework allow modders to use ranged verb functionality from hediff and define custom melee attack with independent gizmo/command button. Allowing your pawn shoulder-mounted cannon to shoot while your pawn use their gun.

This can be done just via xml and you can also define your custom texture for button. **For now this framework is mainly used for my own mod.**
