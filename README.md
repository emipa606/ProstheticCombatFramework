For now, this mod is not classified as abandoned until a better modder makes an overhaul code or a different version with more features. Maybe in the future, I'll update it if not abandoned. Check out the ported version of [PCF from another modder](steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2011169338) as a replacement for now.

**Not Just Another Combat Prostheses Framework**. An expansion of vanilla hediff verb system with advanced verb support and friendly modification via xml.

This framework allow modders to use ranged verb functionality from hediff and define custom melee attack with independent gizmo/command button. Allowing your pawn shoulder-mounted cannon to shoot while your pawn use their gun.

This can be done just via xml and you can also define your custom texture for button. **For now this framework is mainly used for my own mod.**

Put this framework on top of your modlist after core or higher on mod load order with another framework.
