For now, this mod is not classified as abandoned until a better modder makes an overhaul code or a different version with more features. Maybe in the future, I'll update it if not abandoned. Check out the ported version of [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2011169338]PCF from another modder[/url] as a replacement for now.

[b]Not Just Another Combat Prostheses Framework[/b]. An expansion of vanilla hediff verb system with advanced verb support and friendly modification via xml.

[img]https://i.ibb.co/Fb0cCYZ/Details.png[/img]

This framework allow modders to use ranged verb functionality from hediff and define custom melee attack with independent gizmo/command button. Allowing your pawn shoulder-mounted cannon to shoot while your pawn use their gun.

This can be done just via xml and you can also define your custom texture for button. [b]For now this framework is mainly used for my own mod.[/b]

Put this framework on top of your modlist after core or higher on mod load order with another framework.
